&lt;h4 id=&quot;github-pages&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the official introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Websites for you and your projects. Hosted directly from your GitHUb repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what GitHub Pages can do with some examples. (Ranked by Stars)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the official introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;) and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt; renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Github Pages + Jekyll is absolutely a good choice to build our first blog website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-start&quot;&gt;#To Start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create your github repo first (fork or create your own)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;install Jekyll&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For mac user, install your own ruby version first(use rbenv)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#homebrew to install rbenv
~ $ brew update
~ $ brew install rbenv

#install our own ruby
~ $ rbenv install 2.3.1

#check ruby versions
~ $ rbenv versions

#using a ruby in the shell
~ $ rbenv shell 'rubyversion'

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Install Jekyll and create your blog&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ $ gem install bundle
~ $ gem install jekyll
~ $ jekyll new myblog
~ $ cd myblog
~/myblog $ bundle install
~/myblog $ bundle exec jekyll serve
# =&amp;gt; Now browse to http://localhost:4000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;fork from whatever you like from &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org&quot;&gt;Jekyll Theme&lt;/a&gt;, and build your own on it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;List some themes I really like.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I. &lt;a href=&quot;https://luminousrubyist.github.io/airspace-jekyll/&quot;&gt;Airspace&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;II. &lt;a href=&quot;http://joshgerdes.com/jekyll-uno/&quot;&gt;Jekyll-Uno&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/in-post/2016-08-19/jekyll-uno.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;VI. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brianmaierjr.com/long-haul/&quot;&gt;Long Haul&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/in-post/2016-08-19/long-haul.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;V. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bencentra.com/centrarium/&quot;&gt;Centrarium&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/in-post/2016-08-19/centrarium.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
Auther: Ben Centra&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jekyll-directory-structure&quot;&gt;#Jekyll Directory Structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic Jekyll site usually looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
├── _config.yml
├── _drafts
|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.md
|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.md
├── _includes
|   ├── footer.html
|   └── header.html
├── _layouts
|   ├── default.html
|   └── post.html
├── _posts
|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.md
|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.md
├── _data
|   └── members.yml
├── _site
├── .jekyll-metadata
└── index.html

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; stores &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/a&gt; data, including blog title, favicon, description, contact info, visit info (Google Analysis).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes&lt;/code&gt; are the partials that can be mixed and matched by your layouts an dposts to facilitate reuse. The liquid tag &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;include file.ext %}&lt;/code&gt; can be used to include the partial  in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_include/file.ext&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layouts&lt;/code&gt; are the templates that wrap posts. Layouts are chosen on a post-by-post basis in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot;&gt;YAML Front Matter&lt;/a&gt;. The liquid tag &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;content }}&lt;/code&gt; is used to inject content into the web page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; is your dynamic content lies. The naming must follow the format &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; is where the generated site will be placed(by default) once Jekyll is done transforming it. It’s probably a good idea to add this to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; Provided that the file has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot;&gt;YAML Front Matter section&lt;/a&gt;, it will be transformed by Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;
